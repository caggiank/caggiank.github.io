      <h1>About</h1>
      <p style="font-size: 20px;">
        Student Publishing.org is a place where students can upload substantial pieces of work
        that they either created independently or had to create for a class. From final projects, reasearch papers, theses, to passion projects -
        Student Publishing.org is a platform where ideas, knowledge, and research can be shared free of charge and with ease.
        Unlike traditional academic publishing, there are no complex bariers to jump through. At the simple press of a button, college students are transformed into academics.
