Personal Statement: [Kevin Caggiano]
<h1>My Background</h1>
      My name is Kevin Caggiano. I am twenty-one years old and I was born and raised outside of Rochester, NY. I am a senior here at Boston College with a major in International Studies and a minor in Philosophy. I live off campus with four of the best guys in the entire world. I have some experience in IT and web development. I am proficient in Java and I am currently learning Python. I served as the PR director for BCEMS, and one of my roles included updating/editing/monitoring our organization’s website. We used WordPress as our platform.
<h1> My Interest in Web Development </h1>
      My interest in web development spans largely from society’s newfound interconnection with the internet for what seems like nearly everything. Having web development skills will make almost anyone an asset in the workforce. Furthermore, I certainly believe that I will come across some type of web development needs in both my future career and personal life.

<h1>My Extra-Curricular Interests, Sports or Hobbies</h1>
      I have a wide variety of extra-curricular interests. Here at Boston College, I find myself to be quite busy. I am a member of our student run emergency medical services. I am one of the captains of our Club Club Lacrosse team (kind of a mix between official club lacrosse, inter-mural, and a beer league). Outside of BC I am an avid outdoorsman. I love hiking, kayaking, and most importantly fly-fishing which has become more akin to an obsession than a hobby.

<h1>What I Hope to Gain from This Course</h1>
      The number one thing I want to gain from this course is the very marketable skill of web development. Although I love my major, International Studies does not always offer skills that easily transfer to future career endeavors (a notion which I am constantly reminded about by my four STEM siblings). I believe that by adding web development skills to my toolbox, I can become more competitive in the already exceedingly competitive job market.

<h1>Topics or Ideas I Would Like to Discuss and Learn About  (that may not already be included in the course outline)</h1>
* Cyber Security
* E-Commerce
* Multi-media integration
* Streamlining/ease of use
* The future of websites
