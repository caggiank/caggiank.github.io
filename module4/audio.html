    <br>Director Denis Villeneuve recently gave us his take on Frank Herbert’s classic novel Dune. Released last week in theaters and on HBO Max, the film drew tremendous attention, as hopes were high that Villeneuve could do what several directors before him had failed to do - bring Herbert's complex sci-fi masterpiece to life on the big screen. I can firmly say that Villeneuve did not disappoint. This high budget film is complete with a star studded cast with actors like Timothee Chalamet, Zendaya, Oscar Isaac, Josh Brolin, and Jason Momoa taking central roles. This film, coined Dune Part 1, served as our introduction to what obviously will be a multi-part franchise similar to the likes of George Lucas’ Star Wars, or the Marvel Expanded Universe. It attempted to provide background on Herbert's universe, while establishing the role of our protagonist, Paul Atredies (played by chalamet). Through absolutely stunning visuals, phenomenal acting, and the never-disappointing soundtrack provided by Hans Zimmer, this film did everything right, creating millions of fans across the world, desperately waiting for the release of part two.
