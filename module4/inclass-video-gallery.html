       Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (/ˈsɒrən ˈkɪərkəɡɑːrd/ SORR-ən KEER-kə-gard, US also /-ɡɔːr/ -⁠gor, Danish: [ˈsœːɐ̯n̩ ˈɔˀˌpy ˈkʰiɐ̯kəˌkɒˀ] (About this soundlisten);[7] 5 May 1813 – 11 November 1855[8])
       was a Danish philosopher, theologian, poet, social critic, and religious author who is widely considered to be the first existentialist philosopher.[9][10] He wrote critical texts on organized religion,
       Christendom, morality, ethics, psychology, and the philosophy of religion, displaying a fondness for metaphor, irony, and parables. Much of his philosophical work deals with the issues of how one lives as
       a "single individual", giving priority to concrete human reality over abstract thinking and highlighting the importance of personal choice and commitment.

       Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (/ˈheɪɡəl/;[27][28] German: [ˈɡeːɔʁk ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈheːɡl̩];[28][29] 27 August 1770 – 14 November 1831) was a German philosopher.
       He is considered one of the most important figures in German idealism[30] and one of the founding figures of Western philosophy, with his influence extending to
       the entire range of contemporary philosophical issues, from aesthetics to ontology and politics, both in the analytic and continental tradition.

      Martin Heidegger (/ˈhaɪdɛɡər, ˈhaɪdɪɡər/;[12][13] German: [ˈmaʁtiːn ˈhaɪdɛɡɐ];[14][12] 26 September 1889 – 26 May 1976) was a key German philosopher of the 20th century.
      He is best known for contributions to phenomenology, hermeneutics, and existentialism. In Heidegger's fundamental text Being and Time (1927), "Dasein" is introduced as a
      term for the type of being that humans possess.[15] Dasein has been translated as "being there". Heidegger believes that Dasein already has a "pre-ontological" and non-abstract
      understanding that shapes how it lives. This mode of being he terms "being-in-the-world".
